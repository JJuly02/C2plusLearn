# C2plusLearn: My Journey into C++ Programming

Welcome to **C2plusLearn**, a repository documenting my progress and practice in learning C++ during my university studies. This repository contains a variety of programs and exercises, ranging from homework assignments to independent experiments and practical applications of C++ concepts.

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

Here is an overview of the files and directories in this repository:

### **Homework Assignments**
These files include solutions to homework tasks assigned during my C++ course:
- `cezar_pracadomowa2`
- `praca.domowa3`
- `praca_domowa` and `praca_domowa.cpp`
- `hm3.cpp`

### **Lessons and Experiments**
These files include practice exercises and small programs written during lessons or for experimentation:
- `lekcja` and `lekcja.cpp` â€“ Exercises from lessons.
- `kalkulatorcpp` and `kalkulatorcpp.cpp` â€“ A simple calculator program in C++.
- `so1.py` â€“ A Python script for comparison or side-task experiments.

### **Standalone Programs**
These files include standalone tasks and exercises that explore various C++ topics:
- `zadanie17` and `zadanie17.cpp`
- `zadanie18` and `zadanie18.cpp`
- `zadanie19` and `zadanie19.cpp`
- `zadanie20` and `zadanie20.cpp`
- `zadanie21` and `zadanie21.cpp`
- `zadanie22` and `zadanie22.cpp`
- `zadanie23` and `zadanie23.cpp`
- `zadanie24` and `zadanie24.cpp`
- `zadanie25.cpp`

### **General Practice**
These files include miscellaneous practice programs:
- `11` and `11.cpp`
- `13` and `13.cpp`
- `14` and `14.cpp`
- `15` and `15.cpp`

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler like `g++` or an IDE such as Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or CLion.
- Python (optional) for running the `so1.py` script.

### Compile and Run C++ Files
1. Navigate to the folder containing the desired file.
2. Compile the file using `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
